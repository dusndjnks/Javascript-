# What are the variables naming conventions in JavaScript?
## Variable names must start with a letter, an underscore ( _ ) or a dollar sign ( $ ). Variable names cannot contain spaces. Variables cannot be the same as reserved keywords such as if or const . By convention, JavaScript variable names are written in camelCase.

# Create a greeting alert (use=> prompt,message,alert)

## let fn="mhd"
## let ln="affan"
## alert("hello"+" "+fn+" "+ln+" "+Lets Learn JS)

# Write some code so that the values of the below variables switch around

## let a="5"
## let b="8"
## let c=b
## b=a
## a=c
## console.log(a)
## console.log(b)
