## Write a short notes on below array methods with code examples 
### reverse()-method reverses the order of the elements in an array. The reverse() method overwrites the original array.
## sort()-method of Array instances sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the reference to the same array, now sorted. 
## fill()-method fills specified elements in an array with a value. The fill() method overwrites the original array. Start and end position can be specified. If not, all elements will be filled.
## filter()-The filter() method is an iterative method. It calls a provided callbackFn function once for each element in an array, and constructs a new array of all the values for which callbackFn returns a truthy value.
## some()-method checks if any array elements pass a test (provided as a callback function). The some() method executes the callback function once for each array element.
## every()-method executes a function for each array element. The every() method returns true if the function returns true for all elements.
## map()-It creates a new array by calling a function on every element of the original array and storing the results in a new array.
## forEach()-method in JavaScript that allows you to iterate over an array and perform an operation on each element of the array. It takes a callback function as an argument and applies it to each element of the array.
## reduce()-is a predefined method used to reduce an array to a single value by passing a callback function on each element of the array
## indexof()- method of String values searches this string and returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified substring.
