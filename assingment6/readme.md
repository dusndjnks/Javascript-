## 1.Write short notes on Array methods with code examples 
### Push()-is a function in JavaScript that adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array.
### Pop()- method removes the last element from an array and returns that value to the caller. 
### Shift()-method removes the first element from an array and returns that removed element.
### unShift()-method adds new elements to the beginning of an array. The unshift() method overwrites the original array.
### includes()-method is a built-in JavaScript function that checks if a specific element or substring is present in an array or a string, respectively. 
### toString()- method is used internally by JavaScript when an object needs to be displayed as a text (like in HTML), or when an object needs to be used as a string. 
### reverse()- method reverses the order of the elements in an array in place.
### join()- method of Array instances creates and returns a new string by concatenating all of the elements in this array, separated by commas or a specified separator string.
### concat()-method concatenates (joins) two or more arrays. The concat() method returns a new array, containing the joined arrays.
### flat()- method in JavaScript creates a new array with all sub-array elements concatenated into it recursively up to the specified depth.
### slice()- method extracts a part of a string.
### splice()-method is used to add or remove elements of an existing array and the return value will be the removed items from the array.
